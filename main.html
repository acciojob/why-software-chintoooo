	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    
    <p>
        My motivation for becoming a software developer stems from my passion for solving complex problems and the endless creativity coding allows. I have always been fascinated by technology and its power to transform the way we live, work, and communicate. As a developer, I aim to contribute to that transformation by building solutions that can make a difference. The field also offers continuous learning opportunities, which is something I thrive on, as I love acquiring new skills and adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Developing software enables me to combine logical thinking with creativity, making it a deeply satisfying career choice.
